Her dermatologist suggested that she sleep on a silk pillowcase. Unable to find one, Stewart sourced the best silk she could find and wrapped it around her pillow - the improvements to the health and radiance of both her hair and skin were so dramatic, she never looked back. The following year, Stewart and her partner Justin Dubois officially launched SLIP: the first silk pillowcase to be branded and marketed as a beauty product. Developed and refined for over ten years, the brand's signature slipsilk provides the ultimate combination of shine, thickness, softness, and durability for their line of pillowcases, sleep masks, and more.",
